Smart Street light is an automated system which automates the street. The Smart street light
will be turned ON when there are people on the road otherwise the lights will be switched
OFF. With advancement of technology, things are becoming simpler and easier for everyone in
the world today. Automation is the use of control systems and information technologies to
reduce the need for human work in the production of goods and services. In the scope of
industrialization, automation is a step beyond mechanization, whereas mechanization provided
human operators with machinery to assist the users with the muscular requirements of work,
automation greatly decreases the need for human sensory and mental requirements as well.
Automation plays an increasingly important role in the world economy and in daily experience.
Automatic systems are being preferred over manual system. The research work shows
automatic control of streetlights as a result of which power is saved to an extent. The Smart
street light provides a solution for energy saving which is achieved by sensing the approaching
person using the required sensors and then switching ON a block of street lights ahead of the
person. As the person passes by, the trailing lights switch OFF. Thus, we save a lot of energy.
So when there are no people on the streets, then all the lights remain OFF.
